In this version of CLASS you can compute the cosmo observables for axion decay to photons with masses between 5 and 950 eV and couplings between 8e-12 and 1e-15. An exemplary ini file is provided, see:

axion-LAST_ma75_ga2e-13_parameters.ini

To pick the axion mass and coupling provide (carefull mDMdec shall be given in eV and gDMdec in 1/GeV):
mDMdec = 75
gDMdec = 2e-13


The approach followed here leads to max 16% error in the calculation of the optical depth to reionization compared to using directly dark history (DH) ionization history (between z=0 and 3000).


The efficiency tables fh300_,fexc300,fHion300,fHeion300,fcont300 as a fn of mass and coupling and at fixed z=300 are in:

external/heating/axion_f300_gridforCLASS.dat.

Let us emphasize that when the efficiencies were too high they could not be obtained from DH directly. We have fixed them to: fmax = {0.8000, 0.0500, 0.1300, 0.0100 , 0.01000}. Usually the corresponding models would anyway be largely excluded.

They are taken into account using:

f_eff_type = on_the_spot
chi_type = from_axion_file

The modified reionization history considered here uses the default model from Faucher-Giguere (implemented in DH) on the top of which DM decays can add extra ionization and can have some back reaction effects. We implement the modified reionization histories by interpolating a table of log10[ma[eV]] log10[gag[1/GeV]] 10 values of xe (at z=7.318,7.460,7.605,7.753,7.903,8.055,8.211,8.369,8.529,8.693). The latter redchifts are sufficient for a fair sampling of the corresponding reionization history. The table is in:

external/heating/xe_fromDH_reggrid.dat

To take these reionization histories into account in this modified version use:

reio_parametrization = reio_inter
reio_inter_num = 14
reio_inter_z = 0.0, 3.0, 4.0,7.318,7.460,7.605,7.753,7.903,8.055,8.211,8.369,8.529,8.693,8.70169
reio_inter_xe = -2.0, -2.0, -1.0,1.078,0.2154,0.05548,0.01522,0.003371,0.0006024,0.0002133,0.0001965,0.0001967,0.000197,0.0

Notice that the only important input here is the number of redshift points, all other info is recomputed (I know I can make this better at some point...).


Let us emphasize that when the efficiencies were too high the ionization history could not be obtained from DH directly. We have fixed them to: xemax = {1.081, 1.08, 1.08, 1.08, 1.08, 1.08, 1.079, 1.001, 1.001, 
   1.001}; (see get-f300-forCLASS.nb)
